> **Type:** Method pattern
> **Status:** Stable

## CGOV.7:1 - Problem frame {#problem-frame}

Use this pattern when a corporate matter needs review or decision participation protected from an identified interest, when a required independent contribution is missing, or when an expert opinion is being treated as corporate approval.

Start with the matter, applicable authority and conflict conditions. Determine what must be reviewed, by whom, and which participants can make the later decision. Return the review findings and their limits, together with the arrangement and remaining conditions for a disinterested decision. The decision itself is performed under CGOV.11 or an adequate existing corporate procedure.

## CGOV.7:2 - Problem {#problem}

A report can be called independent because its author is outside the company, although payment depends on closing the transaction. A committee can consist of unconflicted members who lack the authority or information needed to decide. Conversely, competent advice can be unnecessarily repeated because nobody distinguishes a required review from an optional additional opinion.

Independence and competence answer different questions. Corporate authority answers another. Conflating them can produce an expensive review that leaves the real decision unprepared.

## CGOV.7:3 - Forces {#forces}

The decision needs useful judgement within its time and resource constraints. Interested participants may hold essential information, while controlling the review through that information defeats its purpose. A mandatory safeguard must be satisfied or the dependent act limited; discretionary investigation should be chosen for the decision it can improve.

## CGOV.7:4 - Solution {#solution}

Arrange the review and the decision separately, then connect the findings to participants who can use them under the governing rules.

### CGOV.7:4.1 - Establish the required contribution {#establish-the-required-contribution}

Recover the matter, the decision maker's powers and the conflict conditions. Identify any required specialist opinion, independent review, abstention, separate consent or eligible composition. Use the applicable rule rather than assuming that every conflicted matter requires the same procedure.

State the question the reviewer must answer. For a transaction it might concern a valuation assumption, alternative terms or consequences for the corporation. A general request to “approve the deal” hides both the substantive question and the authority boundary.

Reuse a sufficiently qualified existing result when permitted and adequate. For optional additional review, compare its attainable effect on the decision with its full burden, including access, interpretation, delay and displaced work. Further inquiry can be declined without treating an unresolved material condition as satisfied.

### CGOV.7:4.2 - Choose reviewers and eligible decision participants {#choose-reviewers-and-eligible-decision-participants}

Determine the relevant independence: from the counterparty, proposer, interested director, controlling holder or another influence named by the matter and its rules. Examine appointments, fees, prior involvement, material relationships and dependence where they affect the judgement. Being external is not a sufficient test of independence.

Select the needed competence and capacity as well. A disinterested reviewer who cannot examine the technical or financial claim does not supply that examination. A specialist can supply analysis to eligible directors without acquiring their decision power.

Establish who may commission the work, receive findings and decide. Recover composition, exclusion, quorum and consent conditions where they apply. Use a suitable existing committee or direct arrangement; establish a new one only when the matter or rule needs it. A proposed replacement member still needs an effective appointment.

### CGOV.7:4.3 - Provide access and obtain a usable review {#provide-access-and-obtain-a-usable-review}

Give the reviewer the question, relevant materials, assumptions, alternatives and known limitations. Make their access sufficient for the required contribution. Where an interested participant controls the information, provide a way to request clarification or report a material limitation to the eligible recipient.

Specify what the review will return: its answer, reasons, scope, material assumptions and unresolved issues. The substantive analysis follows the relevant domain method. A financial valuation and a technical assessment may be needed for the same matter without either answering the other's question.

Allow the reviewer to report an adverse or incomplete result. If needed access is refused or the work cannot answer the question in time, return that limitation and its effect. Do not complete the appearance of review by replacing the missing analysis with a signature.

### CGOV.7:4.4 - Connect findings to the corporate decision {#connect-findings-to-the-corporate-decision}

Give eligible decision participants the findings with their conditions and material dissent. Determine whether the required review has been obtained and whether remaining gaps permit the proposed deliberation or act. Return an affected gap to the relevant practitioner, adjust the proposed act or limit reliance as the governing rules allow.

Preserve what each result establishes. A price opinion can inform deliberation without approving the transaction. A valid participation arrangement enables a decision without predicting its merits. A conditional opinion remains conditional when included in the board papers.

The result can therefore be complete for this method while the board has not yet decided. State what can proceed and which conditions remain. If eligibility, appointment or information access is still proposed, keep that status visible to the practitioner arranging the decision.

## CGOV.7:7 - Conformance Checklist {#conformance-checklist}

Are the review question and later corporate decision distinct? Are independence, competence, authority and effective participation established for their own uses? Can reviewers obtain and question the needed information? Do findings preserve their assumptions and limits? Can the receiver identify both what is available now and what remains to be done?

## CGOV.7:9 - Consequences {#consequences}

Eligible participants can use qualified findings without delegating their decision to the reviewer. Optional duplication becomes easier to avoid, while a required missing contribution remains visible. Some matters cannot proceed under the available time, access or eligible composition; this is a practical limit of the arrangement, not a reason to claim that review succeeded.

## CGOV.7:12 - Relations {#relations}

CGOV.3 identifies the applicable powers; CGOV.6 establishes the relevant conflict conditions. CGOV.5 supplies an oversight design and the conditions for using it. The necessary appointments, powers and support must take effect before practitioners can rely on that arrangement. CGOV.11 uses the resulting findings and participation conditions to perform the corporate act.

PSD.7 helps participants examine claims and preserve material disagreement. FIN and the relevant technical discipline supply their specialist analyses. C.11.DUA supports the choice of optional further inquiry while retaining a binding condition's present force.
